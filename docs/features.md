# Features

Qryptix balances **security, performance, and usability**.  

## Post-Quantum Cryptography
- Built with NIST-approved algorithms: Kyber, Dilithium, SPHINCS+.  
- Resistant to both classical and quantum cryptanalysis.  
- Applied automatically, no configuration needed by the user.  

## Secure AI Deployment
- Deploy machine learning models in **Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)**.  
- Protect model weights, training data, and inference results.  
- Enclaves guarantee no one — not even infrastructure operators — can access the raw data.  

## Distributed Node Network
- Global coverage with independently verifiable nodes.  
- Hardware attestation ensures integrity of each environment.  
- Zero-trust design: no single entity must be trusted.  

## Instant Deployment
- One-command SDK: launch workloads in under 60 seconds.  
- Native Docker support.  
- Automatic scaling and routing.  

## Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)
- Hardware-based key generation and exchange.  
- Any interception attempt is detectable.  
- Provides provable security guarantees.  

## Secure Analytics
- Homomorphic encryption allows computation on encrypted data.  
- Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) enables collaboration without data leakage.
