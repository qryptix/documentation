# Introduction

## What is Qryptix?

Qryptix is a **secure computing infrastructure** designed for the post-quantum era.  
It enables enterprises, governments, and developers to run AI models and sensitive workloads in an environment that is resistant to quantum attacks.

While today’s cryptographic systems (RSA, ECC) are trusted, they will eventually fail once large-scale quantum computers arrive. Qryptix integrates **NIST-approved post-quantum cryptography (PQC)** directly into its distributed compute network.  

In simple terms: by running on Qryptix, your workloads remain protected not just today, but also in the quantum future.

## Why Quantum-Safe Compute Matters

The **“harvest now, decrypt later” problem** is one of the biggest risks in modern cybersecurity. Attackers can steal encrypted data today, store it, and wait for quantum computers to decrypt it in the future.

This is especially dangerous for:

- Healthcare data that must remain private for decades.  
- Financial transactions that can reveal strategies or fraud years later.  
- Classified intelligence and defense information.  

Qryptix solves this by encrypting and processing data with algorithms that are designed to remain secure against quantum threats.
