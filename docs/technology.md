# Technology Stack

Qryptix is structured into four main layers:

## Application Layer
- Developer SDKs and APIs.  
- Web management console.  
- CI/CD integration for automation.  

## Security Layer
- Post-Quantum Encryption (Kyber, Dilithium, SPHINCS+).  
- Quantum Key Distribution (QKD).  
- Hardware-based attestation.  

## Compute Layer
- Trusted Execution Environments.  
- AI/ML runtime for inference and training.  
- Homomorphic computing for privacy-preserving analysis.  

## Network Layer
- Global distributed nodes.  
- Low-latency routing (<500ms).  
- Dynamic auto-scaling.
