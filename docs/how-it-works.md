# How Qryptix Works

Qryptix organizes secure deployment into four steps:

1. **Deploy**  
   - Upload your app or model using the SDK.  
   - Docker containers are supported natively.  
   - A secure enclave is provisioned.  

2. **Encrypt**  
   - Data and models are automatically encrypted with PQC.  
   - Encryption is enforced at rest, in transit, and in execution.  

3. **Attest**  
   - Nodes provide hardware attestation proofs.  
   - Ensures the execution environment has not been tampered with.  

4. **Execute**  
   - Workloads run inside quantum-encrypted enclaves.  
   - Auto-scaling ensures performance.  
   - Global routing keeps latency <500ms.
